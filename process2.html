						crying session to let out her frustration<br />
						Take out on a lot of people when she first lost eye sight<br />
						got fat (1 stone)<br />
						lost fat (2 stone) by counting calories like crazy
						she needed something else to grab on to -> something she could control<br />
						weight was part of it<br />
						also fashion and make up is part of the control<br />
						which is a way of coping<br />
						She hates to cry in front of friends and letting them know that she's unhappy, which she thinks they know deep down<br />
						Maybe if she pretends to be happy then maybe she will become happy.<br />
						She might not be able to go over the fact that she had sight before.
