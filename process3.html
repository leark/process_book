					<li>Challneges: Slowly taking the laptop from my dad. Increasing my use time little by little was tedious and time consuming.</li>
					<li>How could the transition been made better?: If I just had enough money to buy my own laptop or desktop. Laptop was better for portability however.</li>

					<li>End: Yellowstone</li>
					<li>Benefits: Got to see Yellowstone in winter. Animals were cool and the hot springs and geysers were also really cool.</li>
					<li>Challneges: It was really long drive to Yellowstone. My gameboy ran out of battery and I definitely finished whatever book I was reading halfway there. I spent quite a time just sleeping in the car. Also I was not prepared for how cold Yellowstone was going to be and my feet were freezing.</li>
					<li>How could the transition been made better?: If we took an airplane there. That would've solved so many problems. I guess my dad likes driving or something.</li>
