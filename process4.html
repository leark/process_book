One of the constraints we have imposed for the final project is that your design concept needs to include both digital and physical components.
Document 5 different examples of technology design that you use on a regular basis that meet this requirement. For each include:
• Visual documentation
• Description of what the technology is, what it does, how it works and who uses it
• Specifically highlight the digital and material components of the technology
