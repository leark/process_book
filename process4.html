		<h2>Digital and Physical Constraints</h2>
		<ul>

			<li>Map app</li>
			<p>It's on the phone and can connect to car audio via bluetooth to audio navigate. GPS itself is physical in a sense while the app itself is digital. I use GPS mostly when I'm going to a place I have not yet been to.</p>

			<li>iPad</li>
			<p>iPad is a smart tablet made by Apple. It uses iOS as its operating system which has App store where you can buy and download apps. All the interaction with my iPad is by touching the touchscreen, which is physical, while all the information from the iPad that I'm interacting with is digital.</p>
			<img src="img/internet.png" class="pictures">
			<li>Internet</li>
			<p>Internet is network of network of connected computers that share information via Internet protocol suite. Everyone uses internet to some degree. Its physical part is the fiber, copper wire, and wireless signal that transmits the data and the digital part is everything that's being conveyed by the physical part.</p>

			<li>Bus schedule notifier</li>
			<p>Metro and Sound Transit has installed small booths with screens in Seattle that displays real time bus arrival information pulled from onebusaway app. They physical part is the booth with screens and digital part is the bus arrival time. Sadly, I couldn't find pictures of the booths online.</p>
			<img src="img/alarm.png" class="pictures">
			<li>Digital alarm clock</li>
			<p>Digital part of alarm clock is the interface and inner workings. Physical part is the casing and buttons. A lot of people use digital alarm clock because it's easier to read time at night.</p>
