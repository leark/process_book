		<h4>Google Play Music Desktop Web Application</h4>
		<p>The reason I wish I had created it is because I really don’t like how the website is designed right now. Previously, Google Play Music Desktop Web application looked different from the app version that’s available in Android Play store and iOS App store. In my opinion, it used the screen space effectively so that the user had easy time navigating through the web application and showed a lot of information on one page. However when they changed the application to look and behave more like the app, I felt that the change reduced my enjoyment of using it. For example, some buttons I felt were unnecessarily large and took too much space (as if it was designed to be touched not clicked). </p>
